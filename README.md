### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science enthusiast and huge fan of *The Internet*. My ability to learn and focus is somewhat limited due to a brain injury, but I try my best to aspire toward adeptness.

Technologies I'm interested in and have some level of dev experience with include: **vue/nuxt**, **nodejs**, **android**, **ethereum/smart contracts**, **firebase**, **electron**, **AWS**, **python scripting**, and more. 

I'm always open to any sort of collaboration or odd jobs if the price is right or the cause is worth the time and effort. Pronouns are he/him but feel free to use whatever else if you want.
