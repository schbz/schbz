With zeal, I craft web and mobile spheres,
My tale of skill spans many a year.
In collaboration and freelance I strive,
Many active repos concealed from sight.

Forgive me if follow backs are few,
For bustling days dictate what I do.
Though time is scarce, your presence I cheer,
As we navigate this digital frontier.
