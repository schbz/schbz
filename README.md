### Hi there 👋
I'm a computer science enthusiast and huge fan of *The Internet*. My ability to learn and focus is somewhat limited due to a brain injury, but I try my best to aspire toward freelancing, entrepreneurship, and just plain old creating of cool stuff.

Technologies I'm interested in and have some level of dev experience with include: **vue/nuxt**, **nodejs**, **android**, **ethereum/smart contracts**, **firebase**, **electron**, **AWS**, **python scripting**, and probably more that I can't think of right now. 

I'm always open to any sort of collaboration or odd jobs if the price is right or the cause is worth the time and effort. Pronouns are he/him but feel free to use whatever else if you want.
